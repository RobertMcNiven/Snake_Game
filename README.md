# Snake_Game
This is my integration project for COP 1500. It is my take on the classic game 'Snake'.
I made this project independently.
This project was made over the course of 2 weeks so far, I am continuing to update it and add more levels.
I made this project as an assignment but I also wanted to challenge myself which is why I used tutorials and docs to learn pygame, a downloadable library for python.
This project was made from my personal computer, and I worked on it at home, and at school.
