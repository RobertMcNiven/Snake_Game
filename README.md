# Snake_Game
This is my integration project for COP 1500. It is my take on the classic game 'Snake'.
I made this project independently.
This project was made over the course of 3 weeks so far, I am continuing to update it and add more levels.
I made this project as an assignment but I also wanted to challenge myself which is why I used tutorials and docs to learn pygame, a downloadable library for python.
This project was made from my personal computer, and I worked on it at home, and at school.
## Demonstration


## Documentation
Use the mouse to click the "Start" or "Quit" buttons on the intro screen.
Use the arrow keys to move the player(Snake) around.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank all the people who tested my game and gave me advice about where the story should go.

## History


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
I mainly utilized the Pygame library. Other than that, I created my own functions with infinite while loops for each level.
